      <p>Welcome to Reddit <span class="ital">uhh I mean</span> Welcome to Critique Code.
        Are you tired of getting incessantly cyber-bullied on Stack Overflow? Are you tired of
        feeling like a terrible coder who has no business opening up their IDE everyday?
        <br>
        <span class="ital">
          Welcome to Reddit dot com
        </span>
        </br>
        Here you can write the worst code imaginable and post it for a laugh, or if that terrible
        code was an accident, then you can look for feed back.
        <br>
        Are you a great coder looking to help others learn? Are you a bad coder looking to learn? Or
        Are you painfully average and just looking to share the dumbest for loop you could think of
        writing?
