## Description

We're Not Stack Overflow. Welcome to Reddit uhh I mean Welcome to Critique Code. Are you tired of getting incessantly cyber-bullied on Stack Overflow? Are you tired of feeling like a terrible coder who has no business opening up their IDE everyday? Welcome to Reddit dot com Here you can write the worst code imaginable and post it for a laugh, or if that terrible code was an accident, then you can look for feed back. Are you a great coder looking to help others learn? Are you a bad coder looking to learn? Or Are you painfully average and just looking to share the dumbest for loop you could think of writing?
